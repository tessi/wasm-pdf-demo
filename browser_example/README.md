# Browser Demo

This demo is a Website which offers a Download Button. On click, it generates a PDF using the WASM code and offers it as a download.

To run the example, make sure you compiled the WASM file first.

Then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

and open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
